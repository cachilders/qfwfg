## TK
This is ultimately intended for cv via crow as well as midi, but in this early stage it's all PolyPerc and compromise. Yolo.

## Acknowledgements
The `midi_to_hz` method is lifted wholesale from the [spacetime study](https://monome.org/docs/norns/study-3/). Likewise this code draws heavily from the efforts of the norns community.

## Apologies
The name comes from the protagonist of t-zero and Cosmicomics by Italo Calvino. It's a name owing to [Oulipo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo), which feels meaningful here.
